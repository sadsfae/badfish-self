# CHANGELOG


## v1.4.0 (2026-09-25)

### Bug Fixes

- Apply black formatting to main.py and test_vendor_detection.py
  ([`dc53480`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/dc534804f07d4f37f431276bfb542d7a5e77fdea))

- Black formatting for tests and main
  ([`ed964de`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/ed964de14c46dcc8da5957c4d3e758e95c4d4996))

- Black-format emulator.py and main.py
  ([`bf688cb`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/bf688cbd1d2df0c7c4ef3f874b027e05613a9869))

Run black to fix the two lint errors that fail the repo-wide Black check on development: expand the
  state.jobs[job_id] dict literal (over 120 chars) and collapse the parenthesized uloc expression to
  one line.

- Build container images from checked-out code, not cloned master
  ([`d6e5653`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/d6e565396dd86073aee967e197bdf0bd241fee5f))

The default Dockerfile ran 'git clone https://github.com/quadsproject/badfish' with no -b flag, so
  it pulled the repository default branch (master) regardless of what the CI checkout had. The
  development-build workflow therefore published a master/v1.6.0 image as
  quay.io/quads/badfish:development, which lacked development features like the built-in Redfish
  emulator.

Build from the already-checked-out context instead (COPY . /badfish + WORKDIR /badfish). Both
  development-build and production-release workflows already actions/checkout the target ref, so
  this removes the default-branch dependence and the clone race. Added a minimal .dockerignore to
  keep .git and python caches out of the build context.

- Declare openssl dep so RPM %check can run the emulator tests
  ([`fe01c2b`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/fe01c2bc7372367f6257ec4afa926b631b753a26))

The emulator subcommand shells out to openssl to generate its self-signed TLS cert on first run.
  Without openssl in BuildRequires/Requires the rpmbuild %check step (pytest) fails the 3 emulator
  tests with 'openssl not found'.

Add openssl to BuildRequires (for %check) and Requires (runtime), and to the dnf install list in the
  rpmlint workflow.

- Declare openssl dep so RPM %check can run the emulator tests
  ([`77ba663`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/77ba6636ebf341996f3aa2efd590016cbf80b3b9))

The image now builds from the checked-out context instead of cloning the repo, so git is unused at
  build and runtime. Dockerfile_dev and Dockerfile_local are not referenced by any workflow or
  documentation, so remove them.

- Drop unused git install and stale Dockerfiles
  ([`ade92f4`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/ade92f4d8c377fe3dbdb1650e5bfa9f12f47248a))

- Final black fixes
  ([`a524eb6`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/a524eb647eac756601f8b75d7ee73db6c535c325))

- Guard against empty SupportedLinkCapabilities list in list_interfaces
  ([`3a9f6c7`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/3a9f6c792a3e096c8272b9f1f1edc0b15fc51cd6))

- Harden formatted output parsing and check-boot JSON
  ([`578b280`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/578b2800b924fc2f12f3648976623e987c75e36f))

- F3: timestamp-string YAML loader at all four parse() load sites so zero-date ReleaseDate
  (0000-00-00T00:00:00Z) stays a string instead of raising ValueError in yaml.safe_load; ValueError
  added to outer except. - F4: defensive diff() tolerates 0/1 hosts, missing SoftwareId/Version,
  compares Version via str() and avoids zip truncation. - F9: BadfishLogger creates the parent dir
  of --log before FileHandler. - F11/F13: emit structured check-boot data (BootOrder/HostType) and
  guard parse() against missing messages so -o json --check-boot is sensible.

  ([`b202433`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/b2024339312046c061baa1989eab310b9d0203dc))

  ([`ef571da`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/ef571daf3cb6dda78794c4e5f32cb32e89bc3d3c))

Follow-up from independent and adversarial review of the PR: - reject duplicate --attribute-value
  names instead of silently last-wins - error when --attribute-value is mixed with legacy
  --attribute/--value - require --set-bios-attribute when --attribute-value is used (no silent
  no-op) - validate pairs before any session/network work so bad syntax fails fast - resolve
  attributes to the registry canonical AttributeName before the current-value lookup and PATCH (odd
  casing no longer misreported) - skip the PATCH and reboot entirely when every value is already in
  the desired state - pin single-PATCH / no-PATCH counts and add edge-case tests

- Idrac10 virtual media and OS deployment paths
  ([`f7af2a8`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/f7af2a899cc778d9f2fdfa9ceed5e9165b144c74))

Dell 17G hosts (R670, iDRAC10) fail virtual media cleanup and OS deployment with "Could not unmount
  virtual media" and "iDRAC version installed doesn't support DellOSDeploymentService". iDRAC10
  dropped the legacy /redfish/v1/Dell OEM namespace and no longer serves the VirtualMedia collection
  under the manager resource.

Port of quadsproject/quads#723 (commit 0dd27bb4): - find_virtual_media_resource() resolves
  VirtualMedia from the manager then system resource, caching the result. Supermicro keeps VM1. -
  is_optical_media() and get_virtual_media_device() replace the [x for x in vm_config if "CD" in
  x][0] filter; a miss raises BadfishException instead of IndexError. -
  find_os_deployment_resource() tries {system}/Oem/Dell/... then the legacy /redfish/v1/Dell path,
  caching the result. The OS deployment action URIs now use the resolved resource.

- Propagate boot-to failures, join export path, guard init JSON parses
  ([`babdc03`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/babdc03b12f2a4219f8a2f528ea93e97d75d0129))

boot_to_type returns its boot_to result and execute_badfish folds a False result into the exit
  status. export_scp joins the export filename to the target directory instead of concatenating.
  find_systems_resource wraps both response JSON parses in the standard BadfishException guard.

The multi-attribute path silently dropped a value when two attributes differed only by case (e.g.
  ProcC1E and procc1e both mapped to the same canonical name). Make the duplicate check
  case-insensitive, narrow canonical-name resolution to the registry AttributeName field only, and
  raise a catchable BadfishException when the BMC does not expose a BIOS registry instead of
  crashing with a TypeError.

Add --retry=5 --retry-delay=15s to the podman build and push commands in the production release
  workflow so transient Quay CDN connection failures no longer fail releases.

- **emulator**: Generate self-signed TLS cert at runtime, drop shipped private key
  ([`e13936a`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/e13936a4ebc7b1fca4eea1d11b8ff35c54775afa))

The emulator bundled a self-signed private key in SCM and in the wheel/RPM
  (emulator/certs/emulator.key). This removes it from the repo and from package data, and generates
  a fresh per-install localhost keypair on first run under $XDG_CACHE_HOME/badfish/emulator
  (overridable via BADFISH_EMULATOR_CERTS), so no private key ever sits in public artifacts.
  Existing certs are reused; the key is written 0600. Tests cover generation, reuse,
  missing-openssl, default-dir resolution, and the live daemon now exercises runtime generation.

The ServiceRoot advertised Chassis, TaskService and Registries, but all three 404'd, which would
  break any Redfish client that walks the link tree. Serve a Chassis collection, a TaskService
  resource with its Tasks collection, and a Registries collection. The user store is now written
  0600 (not world-readable under a default umask), uses a unique temp filename so concurrent
  instances don't race, and the throwaway default /tmp path is no longer trusted: a pre-existing
  file there (e.g. a locally planted Administrator) is ignored.

  ([`06bcf7c`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/06bcf7c193b5461b5342379f62789bfbf1b64bdf))

Findings from independent + contrarian review of this PR, all verified live:

- NetworkPorts / NetworkDeviceFunctions collections now served (were 500: _STATIC_URI referenced
  templates that don't exist). badfish walks these in get_network_adapters / get_nic_fqdds. -
  DellNetworkAttributes also registered on the Chassis tree (client uses /Chassis/... not
  /Systems/... for get/set_nic_attribute). - SCP export job now carries SystemConfiguration so
  export_scp completes instead of timing out; task template gains Oem.Dell.Message so import_scp's
  progress poll reads cleanly. - DetachISOImage returns 200 like real iDRAC (badfish only accepts
  200). - Last enabled Administrator cannot be demoted via RoleId (previously only disable/delete
  were guarded); roles re-resolved live so demotions take effect on existing sessions instead of a
  login-time snapshot. - Pending restart power-on task is cancelled by any later reset. -
  NetworkPorts member resources served; firmware member ids singularized; reused certs re-applied
  0600. - Tests: network collections + Chassis NIC attribute set, export/import payload asserts,
  live-RBAC demotion, restart override, end-to-end drives
  get_network_adapters/get_nic_fqdds/get_nic_attribute/detach/export_scp.

- **emulator**: Set member Id so boot-to-mac resolves devices
  ([`c181672`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/c181672ac4fbdb393ce17150107ab31e24dc0227))

The EthernetInterface template renders an empty Id, so badfish's boot_to_mac sees device=None and
  raises 'MAC Address does not match any of the existing'. Populate the member Id from its resource
  id so collection members (EthernetInterface, Processor, Memory) carry a real identity and
  boot-to-mac resolves the device.

Adds an rpmlint make target under rpm/ that builds the SRPM and binary noarch RPM and lints the spec
  plus both artifacts, and a GHA workflow that runs it in a fedora:latest container on PRs and
  pushes. Pivots the #312 investigation away from rpminspect, which targets binary packages and
  deviation analysis that do not apply to a noarch pure Python package.

### Continuous Integration

- Gate rpmlint on setup.py and fail loudly on an empty package version

The rpm build derives VERSION from setup.py, but the paths filter omitted it, so a setup.py-only
  change would not re-trigger the gate. Also, if setuptools is unimportable the Makefile silently
  built badfish-.tar.gz with empty @VERSION@ substitutions; the version is now asserted non-empty
  before building.

  built badfish-.tar.gz with empty @VERSION@ substitutions; the version is now asserted non-empty
  before building.

- Only run the dev Quay publish from the canonical repo
  ([`400fd9c`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/400fd9cd30d01508110eadd57c7083841190728f))

Forks don't have the QUAY_USERNAME/QUAY_API_TOKEN secrets, so the Development Build workflow dies at
  podman login on every fork push (empty password -> 'inappropriate ioctl for device'). Gate the
  quay_dev job to this repo so forks skip it and the dev image is still published from
  quadsproject/badfish exactly as before.

  ([`c2ff592`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/c2ff592062bc6a97d1392497b75231cf0fc42bce))

- Support setting multiple BIOS attributes in one invocation
  ([`c129012`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/c1290127d76052ea0386674241ddd98b5e5777e4))

The --set-bios-attribute path now accepts a repeatable --attribute-value option taking
  attribute=value pairs, so multiple BIOS attributes are staged and applied in a single operation
  and one reboot. Existing --attribute/--value usage is unchanged.

The accepted-value check is reset per attribute so an invalid value is not masked by an earlier
  accepted one, and accepted values are sent using the registry's canonical casing.

- **emulator**: Accountservice user management with role-based RBAC
  ([`8890a54`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/8890a54231b41fbe53db558ac6d82bf899317ea8))

Adds the Redfish AccountService surface to the mock iDRAC: a JSON-backed user store (created at
  runtime, /tmp by default, BADFISH_EMULATOR_USERS to relocate), roles
  ReadOnly/Operator/Administrator, per-role authorization on mutating requests, and the
  last-enabled-Administrator guard. Users can be created, edited, removed and have passwords changed
  over the API, so future badfish user/RBAC client work has a stable target.

The store stays a flat JSON file rather than sqlite on purpose: the emulator is a temporal testing
  fixture, not a persistent service, and JSON keeps the state human-inspectable and aligned with the
  DMTF/sushy mockup convention. sqlite would be stdlib-safe too, but its durability/concurrency
  advantages are precisely what this throwaway scope does not need.

Also ships the account_service and account templates (previously missing), warts the e2e test off
  the shared /tmp default store, and declares template and cert package_data so the emulator
  actually runs from an installed wheel or RPM (templates were previously omitted from the build
  entirely).

  ([`183bb65`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/183bb6588631f7b0c4fe962eb2f64b8c39bb4b99))

Adds a mock iDRAC server so badfish can be developed and tested without bare metal. Run with
  "badfish --redfish-emulator --port 8443"; it always runs as a persistent server until interrupted.

Design: static resource shapes live as JSON templates under

src/badfish/emulator/templates, served over HTTPS by a small aiohttp app with an in-memory fake
  driver holding mutable system state. Architecture is inspired by the sushy-tools emulator
  (OpenStack, Apache-2.0), written independently for badfish under GPL-3.0-or-later.

Covers the surface badfish actually talks to: session/token auth, power and reset, one-shot boot and
  boot order, BIOS registry and attributes, jobs queue, virtual media, firmware inventory,
  processor/memory/network inventory, the Dell OS deployment service and SCP targets, and the Dell
  network attribute registry. Screenshot and network ISO actions report "not supported" so badfish
  degrades gracefully.

Default credentials are quads/quads (override with BADFISH_EMULATOR_USER and
  BADFISH_EMULATOR_PASSWORD). TLS uses a bundled self-signed test certificate, so clients should
  pass --insecure.

Tests: unit coverage of the API surface plus an end-to-end test that

runs the real badfish client against a live emulator over TLS.

Per maintainer direction on review follow-ups: - Jobs report Running/0% on the first read, then
  Completed/100% on the next, so badfish's poll-and-retry job loops exercise a real lifecycle
  instead of instant success. The job-creation POST body renders without consuming a read so the
  first client poll sees the running state. - Import tasks are now tracked;
  TaskService/Tasks/<unknown> 404s like real iDRAC (badfish only polls tasks it created via SCP
  import). - RBAC intentionally left permissive: Operator may run SCP/job actions.

### Refactoring

- Canonicalize BIOS attribute names in a single pass

Grafuls (review): the nested loop was O(entries x attributes). Build a lowercase->canonical
  AttributeName map once, then resolve each supplied attribute with one lookup. Behavior unchanged
  (38 BIOS tests pass).

Make _collection_uri data-driven (open/closed: a new collection is a row in _COLLECTIONS, not a new
  branch), centralize the malformed-JSON 400 handling in _read_body (was 8 duplicated blocks), and
  factor the JID_ generation into _next_job_id (was 3 duplicated blocks). The extended flag for
  splitting the 919-line god-module into multiple files was deliberately deferred: the independent
  review judged a single file defensible for a dev-only mock, the module's helpers are referenced
  directly by the tests, and a physical split would churn tests and package_data for little gain.

  ([`9f67459`](https://github.com/sadsfae/badfish-self/commit/9f6745934f0e6ae9352e88ac024c2d81b11d8721))

Codecov patch coverage on the new emulator surface was 74.45% against a 93.43% target, pulling the
  PR check red. Adds targeted tests for the member collections (NIC/CPU/DIMM), session and registry
  resources, malformed-JSON 400s on every JSON reader, ChangePassword and account PATCH/DELETE error
  paths, reset variants and BIOS/Manager actions, the Dell OEM endpoints (job queue, OS deployment,
  SCP import/export, screenshot), PATCH/DELETE fallthroughs, garbage Basic auth, corrupt-store
  recovery, and a live run_daemon smoke test plus the main() routing branch.

Two small correctness fixes surfaced while chasing coverage: the chassis Power consumption was dead
  code (shadowed by the static URI map), so it never varied with power state, and run_daemon now
  returns web.run_app() so callers can drive it. Patch coverage is now ~99%.

fixes: https://github.com/redhat-performance/badfish/issues/498

* We now properly check SSL connections and offer an --insecure parameter. * export_scp hang bug:
  Fixed by discovering that Dell iDRAC API endpoints (both Tasks and Jobs) return stale/cached
  status data showing "Running" indefinitely even after the job * Add more fixes for --export-scp
  feature * Workaround: Instead of unreliable polling, we now wait 45 seconds which is more than
  enough time then fetch json. * This now fully works and is fast.

* find_session_uri masks a proper error message when someone passes incorrect credentials (either by
  vars or user/pass). * response body seems to be a JSON object and not a redfish root object and we
  are not generating a useful error, instead the user gets a traceback that masks the real cause.
